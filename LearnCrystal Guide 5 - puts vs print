Puts vs Print

In crystal programming there are two ways we can print- this being based off of ruby syntax

puts: This will print the information but when the information is done printing, it will print out a new line. 
This is useful for printing out long number lists or short variables

print: This will print the data as is and will not add a new line to the end. This can be useful for multiple variable lines like such:

catsnumber = 12
catowner = author
print catowner+"has"+catsnumber+"cats"

This will print aurthor has 12 cats

In the next guide we will talk about how to break lines within a print or puts command and also how to add tabs
