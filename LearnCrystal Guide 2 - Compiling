Compiling is short and simple in crystal
Thanks to awesome compilling modes, we can choose between two different compiling modes
  The first one (and the one that I recomend that you use for now) compiles quickly and runs at almost native performance once compiled
  The second mode (and the one that I recomend for publishing large projects) compiles at a slower speed, but runs at a native speed
  **Make sure you have your crystal package install (guide 1) in order to run this compiler
      **also make sure that you are in your CrystalDocs foler (or where ever you put your crystal file)

  Fast compile..Slow performance - Here's how to do this one, Open your terminal and type this in
             crystal build ProgramNameOrFileName.cr
             
            Same almost the same command for the slow compile but fast performance mode :
                     crystal build ProgramNameOrFileName.cr --release
                     
Now compiling and then running are great. When you are done you will get a file that you can execute.
               To do that, it will be in the same foler so just go into your terminal and type in ./ProgramNameOrFileName 
               Obviosly putting in the name that you used before
               
There is one more important mode in the crystal compiler that allows us to compile and run at the same time but will not make a sharable executable
    That command is: 
      crystal run ProgramOrFileName.cr
      
      **on a side note, you can remove the word run and get the same effect
      
      
That is all that you need to know about compiling for now, hopefully you have made a hello world file in crystal and have used these comiling instructions to run it
