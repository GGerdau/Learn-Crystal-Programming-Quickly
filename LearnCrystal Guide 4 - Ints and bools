There are a couple of logic literals that should be talked about first
Those being:
true
false
nil

True means that a boolean is true
False means that a boolean is false
and nil means that a Literal has no value

For example:
Take this statement - Thomas has 2 red cars and no blue cars.
This would make - 
RedcarOwnership = true
bluecarOwnership = false
orangecarOwnership = nil

Redcar ownership is true because he has two red cars, blue car is false because he has none, and orange cars is set to nil because it was never stated.
