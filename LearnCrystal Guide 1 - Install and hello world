This is a simple guide to learning crystal. 
Crystal only compiles on *nix right now, so you'll have to be using a unix based os. Ubuntu, fedora, arch, osx etc...

Ubuntu/Debian - I will only be covering these, but more can be found here on compiling on line 10
Crystal is easy to setup with terminal commands: Run these now from root
          curl http://dist.crystal-lang.org/apt/setup.sh | sudo bash
          apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 09617FD37CC06B54
          echo "deb http://dist.crystal-lang.org/apt crystal main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/crystal.list
          apt-get install crystal
  - Other OS http://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/index.html
  
  So now you should have Crystal completely installed. Let's make a hello world to test it out.
        First you might want to make a folder to store all of your Crystal programs.
        I like to keep all of mine in a folder called CrystalDocs in my home Directory.  To do this just do "mkdir ~/CrystalDocs"
        Crystal has a ruby based syntax which means that it is "easy" to start with
        Open up your favorite text editor (gedit, kate, vim, emacs, etc...)
        Now hello world in crystal only takes one line. We will be using the "puts" method in order to get it to display on our screen
        Line one should look like this:
        
        puts "hello there!"

        Now that that is out of the way, save it in your CrystalDocs folder (or wherever you like) and make sure to save it with a .rc extension.
        I named mine CrystalHelloWorld.rc
        
        That is it for this Guide, to learn how to compile, please open the second guide in this tutorial and we will cover the different methods of compiling (fast/slow)
