Alright, we've made it this far, but in order to make use of the variables that we've gather from the user from the gets statements.
Here's how to do it:
  There are a couple of operators that you need to know:
  ==  means that these numbers are equal
  < means that the first number is less than the next number
  > means that the first number is greater than the next number
  <= means that the first number is less than the next number OR equal to it
  >= means that the first number is greater than the next number OR equal to it
  != means that the first number is not equal to the next number
  
Now, witha all of these learned (and you will need to know them), let's proceed onto how to structure the if statement in crystal
First and foremost the statement should be done in a way that allows the user to easily read the code that you are writing, this is great, but it's challange for most novice programmers
Here is a good rule of thumb, always go the easy way, unless your functionality won't allow you to, this allows other to read your code
now that you know that easy is almost always the best way all if statements start like this:

if (thingOneorVariableOne > thingTwoOrVariableTwo)
#DO STUFF HERE
end

That's it
That's all you need to know for now.
