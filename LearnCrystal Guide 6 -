Alright, I know I promised how to do casting in this guide; that will come at the end.
Right now I think that knowing strings is more important than knowing how to cast.
Crystals String system is increadibly easy

The most basic type of string in Crystal is the default string:

"Hello, this is a string"

We can asign this string to a variable, let's do that:

helloWorldString = "Hi, and welcome"

and with that string we can do:

puts helloWorldString

and we'll get "Hi, and welcome" printed on the screen
