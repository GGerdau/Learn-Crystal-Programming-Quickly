The standard .scanner will not work in cyrstal because it has a ruby based syntax, what needs to be used here instead is a gets method

The gets method is actually fairly simple, and for a allmost all intents and purposes, gets will get the job done for simple command line crystal programs 
  Let's take a look at some gets code:
  
  print "Please enter a number!"
  numberThatUserEntered = gets
  numberTimesOneThousand = numberThatUserEntered * 1000
  puts "Your number times One Thousand = "+numberTimesOneThousand
  
  What this will end up giving us:
  
  Please enter a number
  5
  5000

While that might not be the most useful application in the world, it is a good demonstration of what is to come and
what can be done now. There are a lot of possibilites for these types of command enter applications, it's just that not
everyone wants to use one with everything being on the web and all. I keep a collection of mine mainly as extra methods.
